# License_Plate_Identification_and_Feeing_System
This project is a YOLOv8n-based license plate recognition system that uses transfer learning to detect only license plates, runs efficiently on CUDA-supported GPUs, and applies OpenCV preprocessing to enhance plate visibility before recognition. Detected plate regions are cropped and processed, then Tesseract OCR (configured for alphanumeric license plates) extracts the characters, followed by text cleaning operations such as space/line removal, uppercase conversion, and minimum length checking. A modern dark-themed Tkinter interface was developed to allow users to load the model, select images, perform analysis, and view the results easily.
